
This is a short readme describing the layout of PyEmu.

PyContext.py: A module containing a class for defining a context to pass between modules in the emulator
PyCPU.py: The CPU class implements each instruction and is responsible for executing and maintaining state
PyDebug.py: A simple class to ease some debugging tasks
PyEmu.py: The user facing class that implements the public methods available for use.  Also is responsible for initiating the memory and cpu classes
PyInstruction.py: A helper class for providing abstracted access to the pydasm instruction structures
PyMemory.py: A module containing the memory managers responsible for fetching and storing memory
PyOS.py: A rough implementation of needed OS specific structures for process creation and control.
